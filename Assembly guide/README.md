# Assembly instructions

## Initial setup



| Instruction | Picture |
| -----------------|----------------|
| - Gather pieces | ![](./00.jpg) |
| - Tap the three carrier blocks with an M4 tap | ![](./01.jpg) | 
| - Tap the Z interferometer carrier mounting holes with an M4 tap |  | 
| - Cleanup the M4 rod guiding holes | ![](02.jpg) | 
| - Cleanup the Carrier blocks mounting holes | ![](03.jpg) | 

## Z AXIS

| Instruction | Picture |
| -----------------|----------------|
| - Mount the Z carrier block with two M4 flat head screws and nuts : pay attention to the orientation ! | ![](04.jpg) ![](05.jpg) ![](06.jpg) ![](07.jpg) |
| - Mount the interferometer carrier | ![](08.jpg) ![](09.jpg) ![](10.jpg) |
| - Prepare a M4 rod with two M4 nuts tightened against each other at the end and secured with cyanoacrylate glue |  ![](11.jpg) ![](12.jpg) ![](13.jpg) |
| - This becomes a kind of handle : use it to run the rod through the whole Z stage, starting at the bottom | ![](14.jpg) ![](15.jpg) ![](16.jpg) |
| - Butt the two nuts against the lower Z rod guide | ![](17.jpg) |
| - On the other side, run three nuts, two of which must butt against the upper Z rod guide, be tightened against each other, and secured with CA glue. They must butt against the guide as any space left here will become backlash in the Z axis. | ![](18.jpg) ![](19.jpg) |
| - Add the Z knob, add another M4 nut, and secure this assembly very well by tightening it and adding CA glue | ![](20.jpg) ![](21.jpg) ![](22.jpg) |
| - Add oil on the rod, on both sides of the Z carrier block, and where the nuts butt against the guides. | ![](23.jpg) |
| - Add the Z handle  | ![](24.jpg) |

**Congratulations ! You have completed the Z axis !**

## Y AXIS


| Instruction | Picture |
| -----------------|----------------|
| - Take the Y axis upper part and run 2 M4 screws through the Z axis mounting holes | ![](25.jpg)  | 
| - Screw the Z axis to the Y axis |  ![](26.jpg) | 
| - Add CA glue where the two Z axis pillars meet the Y axis top | ![](27.jpg) | 
| - Take the Y axis carrier block and run two M4 screws through it | ![](28.jpg) | 
| - Place it on the lower Y axis, and run this in the Y gliders | ![](29.jpg) ![](30.jpg)   | 
| - Flip the assembly and secure the screws through the hole | ![](31.jpg) ![](32.jpg) ![](33.jpg) ![](34.jpg)| 
| - You now have a free-gliding Y axis. Repeat the steps of the Z rod assembly to add motion. | ![](35.jpg) ![](36.jpg) | 

**Congratulations ! You have completed the Y axis !**

## X AXIS

| Instruction | Picture |
| -----------------|----------------|
| - Repeat those same steps for the X axis. |![](37.jpg) ![](38.jpg) ![](39.jpg) ![](40.jpg) | 

**Congratulations ! You have a full XYZ table !**

## BEFORE USE

- Lubricate every mating surface on every axis
- Lubricate every spot where nuts butt against rod guides
- Lubricate rods on each side of the carrier blocks
- Run each axis two times from an end to another
